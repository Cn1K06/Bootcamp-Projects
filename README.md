Logistic Regression is applied on the second Project, an introduction to Machine Learning Models. It is about classification of Music Style. 

The third Project is a Natural Language Processing on Twitter Hate Speech Data by implementing Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting)

For Unsupervised Machine Learning Project, we have developed a Book Recommendation as a Group Project. The names of the books were in German. We used Word2Vec Model to get recommendations

My graduation Project is about Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network. Creating new Images from CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset using Discriminator and Generator Models
